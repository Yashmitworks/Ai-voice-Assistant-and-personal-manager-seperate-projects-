AI Assistant
handles your emails , schedule , to-do lists , keeps you updated on Slack messages , and performs online research for you üîç‚Äîall through your favorite messaging app.**

This project provides a personal assistant agent that manages tasks related to your email inbox, calendar, Notion to-do list, Slack interactions, and handles any research you may have. The assistant communicates with you via your preferred communication channel (Telegram, Slack, or WhatsApp), keeping you informed about your schedule, tasks, emails, messages, and helping with research topics, people, or even companies.

The personal assistant is a hierarchical multi-agents system with a supervisor agent (manager) and several sub-agents that handle specific tasks and tools for efficient task management.

Overview
Main Agent: Assistant Manager
The Assistant Manager is your personal assistant that orchestrates the tasks and communication between you and the sub-agents. The manager is responsible for:

Receiving and analyzing your messages from your chosen communication channel.
Delegating tasks to the appropriate sub-agent (Email, Calendar, Notion, Slack, or Researcher).
Communicating updates, messages, and any queries back to you via your preferred channel.
